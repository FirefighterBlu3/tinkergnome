Raspberry PI module (Python 3) for controlling a network of sensors and gadgets on a D&D gaming table
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

the module is designed to be inclusive of all needed code.  you don't need any 3rd
party Raspberry PI python modules.  presently implemented is the standard GPIO bit
twiddling, soon to be implemented are the I2C and SPI protocols.  yes, i know RPio
exists, but it doesn't have all the parts i want/need.  further, the best way for
me to learn the internals of the PI, are to write control methods myself.

project was started for xmas of 2012. copyrighted 2012, david ford.  license, free
for any use but _please_ release your code free to everyone. mention of me is nice,
but i won't chop off your fingers if you don't.
